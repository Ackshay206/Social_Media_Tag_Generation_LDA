# Social media Topic modeling and Hashtag generation using LDA

This project aims to analyze a collection of tweets to uncover underlying topics, trends, and sentiments. Social media platforms like Twitter contain vast amounts of unstructured text data that can provide valuable insights into public opinion, trending topics, and sentiment distribution. We employ the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to extract latent topics within tweets, followed by various post-processing analyses to provide a comprehensive view of the data. This pipeline allows us to transform raw tweets into actionable insights through structured data analysis and visualization.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal is to answer questions such as:
 - What are people talking about on social media? - Extract main topics in the data.
 - How do topics vary over time? - Understand trends and the evolution of topics.
 - What are peopleâ€™s sentiments around these topics? - Perform sentiment analysis to gauge the positivity, negativity, or neutrality of 
opinions.
 - How can we automate insights into hate speech or hashtags? - Identify specific instances of hate speech and generate relevant hashtags.

## Quick Start

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Extract topics from tweets using the LDA model.
- Perform sentiment analysis and other post-processing tasks to gain insights into tweet content.
- Visualize results using a graphical user interface.

## Workflow

### 1. Tweet Extraction
- Data is sourced from the Cardiff NLP tweet topic dataset
- Dataset contains labeled tweets with multiple topics
- Raw data is stored in JSON format in the data directory
- Each tweet includes date, text, ID, and topic labels

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Removal of special characters, URLs, and mentions
- Tokenization and stop word removal
- Part-of-speech tagging to extract relevant nouns
- Denoising of text using custom preprocessing pipeline

### 3. Data Preparation
- Conversion of raw JSON to structured CSV format
- Organization of data into preprocessed and processed directories
- Creation of vocabulary and word indices for LDA model
- Batch processing of tweets for efficient training

### 4. Training the LDA Model
- Implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation using Variational Bayes
- Hyperparameter tuning (alpha, beta)
- Topic modeling with configurable number of topics
- Iterative training process with convergence monitoring
- Generation of topic-word distributions

### 5. Model Testing
- Evaluation of topic coherence
- Assessment of model convergence

### 6. Visualization
- Interactive web interface using Flask
